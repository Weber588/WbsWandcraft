    - 'Welcome to WbsWandcraft! This wand-building plugin is based around three main items: <click:run_command:''/wwc tutorial Wands''><aqua>Wands</aqua></click>, <aqua>Spells</aqua>, and <aqua>Modifiers</aqua>.'
    - '<aqua>Wands</aqua> are items that have an inventory, which can be accessed by right clicking while sneaking. They can only contain Spell and Modifier items.'
    - '<aqua>Spells</aqua> are items that store a magical effect, which can be cast by a Wand. You can see what a spell does by using <aqua>/wwc info <spell></aqua>.'
    - 'Spells have no functionality on their own, they must be added to a Wand to be cast.'
    - 'When you right click a Wand, it runs through the items inside left-to-right, then top-to-bottom, casting the Spells it comes across.'
    - 'If the Wand contains any <aqua>Modifiers</aqua>, they will affect details about the spells being cast, often modifying its <click:run_command:''/wwc tutorial Attributes''><aqua>Attributes</aqua></click>'
